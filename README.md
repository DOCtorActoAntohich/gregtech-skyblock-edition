# GregTech - Skyblock Edition

GSE is a lightweight Skyblock modpack focused around GTCEu and Ex Nihilo with some QoL mods.

Inspired by [GregBlock](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregblock)
and [Gregicality Skyblock Edition](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregicality-skyblock-edition),
this pack is intended to fix GregBlock's issues and avoid some of Gregicality's grind.

## Building

Python 3.10 or newer is required.

1. Run `pip install -r build/requirements.txt` to install required libraries.
2. Run `python -m build` in command line.

To clean output directory, check out `python -m build.clean -h`
